# Rock-paper-scissors Game

## Project Description
The project is a rock-paper-scissors game. It's made using javascript and runs solely on the console and consists of 5 rounds.  
It generates a random choice for the computer, gets an input from the usesr for their choice and uses the two to play and decide the winner.  
This process is iterated through 5 times. Finally, the scores are announced and the winner is declared.  
  
It mostly uses functions, function callbacks and switch cases.
